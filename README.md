# PyCitySchools Data Trends

Th Top performing schols by overall passing were: 
Calbrera High School 
Thomas High School
Griffin High School 
Wilson
Pena High School 

4 of these schools with the exclusion of Pena highschool have a budget of approximately 1 million. With the top  performing school Calbera of student budget of $582.00. 
When comparing this to the bottom performing schools the average student budget is much higher. This suggests that the budget of the school does not necessarily equate to student performance and this should 
be investigated further. 

When reviewing the scores by school type we find a trend between charter and district schools, with charter schools having a higher percent of passing students than district schhols. I would want to conduct further statistical analysis to review the correlation of these trends. 
There could be other variables such as location, median income, demogrpahics that have an effect on performance.
